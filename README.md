# CricTeam (you can download .pbix file from here and view it in POWER BI to see my project)
This is a POWER BI dashboard project where i have cleaned, preprocessed, analysed and then visualised the data given in different CSV files {messy data) extracted from online platforms such as ESPN and Kaggl. These files contain data of World Cup performances by players and the matches scorecards and details.

In this project you can select the best possible 11 players team acording to you that can perform very good in next match.
This project can be utilised by people who bet on online platforms and the companies who organize these betting contests such as Dream 11 and so on.
